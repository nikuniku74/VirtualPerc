## Callback (real-time)

```
getNextAudioBlock
  copy device input into a scratch buffer (never clear first)
  mix assigned inputs → mono analysis
  NeuralBeatTracker.feed(mono)     // SPSC, even after STOP
  BeatTracker reads BeatHypothesis // seqlock
  TempoFollower.advance(numSamples)
  if armed and state in {FOLLOWING, LOW_CONFIDENCE, RECOVERING}
      PercussionEngine.render(shaker hits on grid crossings)
      // or TimeStretchEngine if a loop kit is loaded
  else
      silence
  apply percussion * master volume
```

No allocations, file I/O, logs, mutexes, or UI in this path. Buffers are reserved in `prepare()`.

## Clock

`beatPhase` ∈ [0, 1) is the position inside the current quarter note.

Each sample: `beatPhase += tempo / 60 / sampleRate`.

Tempo is a smoothed `currentTempo` chasing `targetTempo` from the neural hypothesis (or tap). Phase error from the decoder is applied with a clamped PLL gain. Changing tempo never wraps `beatPhase` to 0.

Bar phase assumes 4/4: `barPhase = (beatIndex % 4 + beatPhase) / 4`.

## Voices

Up to 12 overlapping grains. Retriggering an instrument releases its previous voice over a ~2.5 ms ramp starting at the new note's sample offset, rather than switching it off mid-cycle; only when no voice is idle at all is the quietest one taken outright, which the tests assert never happens on a 1/16 grid. Sample data lives in a precomputed buffer generated at prepare.

## Latency display

Shown value = device input latency + output latency + buffer size, converted to ms. It is **measured from the device**, not a marketing guarantee.

## Offline

`VirtualPercussionEngine::process` is the same function used live and in tests. Tests inject synthetic audio instead of a device.
